# Electric Power Consumption Analysis

This project analyzes electric power consumption data to identify patterns and trends. Using R for data processing and visualization, it provides insights into energy usage over time and across different sub-metering categories.

🚀 Project Objectives
🌟 Explore patterns in electric power consumption.
📊 Visualize energy usage trends using interactive and static plots.
🔄 Provide reproducible code for further analysis.
📂 Key Features

Data Filtering: Processes raw data to extract meaningful subsets for analysis.

## Visualizations:
📈 Histogram: Distribution of Global Active Power.
📉 Time Series: Changes in power consumption over time.
⚡ Sub-Metering Comparison: Energy usage across different sub-metering categories.
🔎 Multi-Panel Plot: Consolidated view of voltage, power, and sub-metering trends.
Dataset: Includes pre-processed data for reproducibility.

## 🛠️ Project Structure
1. R Scripts
Loading Data with Filter.R: Reads and filters raw data for analysis.
Plot 1 - Histogram.R: Generates a histogram of Global Active Power.
Plot 2 - Line Plot.R: Creates a time series plot of power consumption.
Plot 3 - Multi-Line Plot.R: Compares energy sub-metering trends.
Plot 4 - Multiple Base Plots.R: Produces a multi-panel plot for comprehensive analysis.

2. Dataset
household_power_consumption.txt: Raw dataset used for generating visualizations.

3. Output Plots
plot1.png: Histogram of Global Active Power.
plot2.png: Line plot of Global Active Power over time.
plot3.png: Multi-line plot for energy sub-metering.
plot4.png: Multi-panel plot of energy metrics.
📊 Technologies Used
Programming Language: R


## Libraries:
data.table: For fast data manipulation.
ggplot2: For creating elegant visualizations.
Base R plotting functions for multi-panel visualizations.


## 📖 How to Use:
Clone the repository:
